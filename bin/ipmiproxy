        # From stdio library man (https://linux.die.net/man/3/read):
        #   When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:
        #     - if no process has the pipe open for writing, read() shall
        #       return 0 to indicate end-of-file.
        #     - if some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK
        #       is set, read() shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].
        #     - if some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK
        #       is clear, read() shall block the calling thread until some
        #       data is written or the pipe is closed by all processes that
        #       had the pipe open for writing.
        #
        # Therefore, unless O_NONBLOCK is set (default python behavior),
        # any self.content.read() call will block until new data arrives.
        #
        # Looking at Python's fileio source code, O_NONBLOCK is never set:
